          <h2>Welcome to Los Santos</h2>
          <p>When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber, and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government, and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody — least of all each other.</p>
          <p>Current PC players can transfer both GTAV Story Mode progress and GTA Online characters and progression with a one-time migration from the legacy version of GTAV to GTAV Enhanced.</p>
          
          <h3>Stunning Visuals</h3>
          <p>Enhanced levels of fidelity and performance with new graphics modes including ray tracing features such as ambient occlusion and global illumination, ray traced shadows and reflections, support for AMD FSR1 and FSR3, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, and more.*</p>

          <h3>Faster Loading</h3>
          <p>Quicker access to the action as the world of Los Santos and Blaine County load in faster than ever before by using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices.</p>

          <h3>Immersive Controls</h3>
          <p>Feel new levels of responsiveness with dynamic resistance via the Adaptive Triggers on the DualSense™ wireless controller, from directional damage to weather effects, rough road surfaces to explosions, and much more.*</p>

          <h3>3D Audio</h3>
          <p>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music.* Hear the sounds of the world with pinpoint precision: the throttle of a stolen supercar, the rattle of neighboring gunfire, the roar of a helicopter overhead, and more.</p>

          <h3>Grand Theft Auto Online</h3>
          <p>Experience GTA Online, a dynamic and ever-evolving online universe for up to 30 players, where you can rise from street-level hustler to become a kingpin of your own criminal empire.</p>
          <p>Enjoy new high-performance vehicle upgrades and improvements like the Career Builder as well as all GTA Online gameplay upgrades, expansions, and content released since launch, ready to enjoy solo or with friends. Pull off daring co-operative Heists, enter adrenaline-fueled Stunt Races, compete in unique Adversary Modes, or hang out in social spaces including nightclubs, arcades, penthouse parties, car meetups, and much more.</p>

          <h3>Exclusive Content & Career Builder</h3>

          <p>Get started in GTA Online with the tools of the trade. Quickly choose from one of four businesses — Biker, Executive, Nightclub Owner, or Gunrunner — and select from properties, powerhouse vehicles, and weaponry to kick-start your enterprise.</p>
